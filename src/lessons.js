    main: "HARD WORK IS MORE VALUABLE THAN TALENT",
    body:
      "Talent is great if you have it, however, it will not take you anywhere you want. " +
      "Learning programming is like learning an instrument, an example is a guitar. At first you will be bad " +
      "at it and that is the most normal thing to happen, so do not feel bad about it. However, after creating something, like a website, you will feel like a genius. That is proof that you are learning. Then again, there will come a time where you will be bad on something that you are doing, now that is proof that you are growing as a programmer. " +
      "Learning is enjoyable, but it is truly painful, the reason for that is because we need pain to grow. Just like in playing a guitar, you will hurt your finger for a long time until you develop callouses that will lessen the pain. ",
    takeaway:
      "Learning how to code or program is a repetitive pattern of being good and being bad in what you are doing. The only thing that will be the same is you will always learn something new.",

    id: 2,
    main: "LEARN PATTERNS",
    body: "At first, you might think that languages are the first thing you need to learn in order to be a programmer. While that is true, the actual first thing that you should understand are patterns. As a living example, I have developed a simple system using PHP before, but now, I do not even remember the correct declaration of an array using that language. What I remembered though are the repetitive patterns I have made, the errors I encountered, and the bugs that popped out of nowhere. What you will need to understand to become a good progammer are the patterns you do when building something, these repetitions are from the problem solving you have been doing when coding, may it be debugging or implementing something. Store it in your mind and use them as tools to build better the next time.",
    takeaway:
      "There is no best programming language, there are only great programmers. Hone your skills and upgrade your tools, these are essential.",

    main: "HOW TO BECOME A GOOD PROBLEM SOLVER",
    body: "Put in the work. This step is the same in any other skill you want to enhance, you will not become the best gamer by watching pros, you will not be better in playing guitar by watching others, and certainly, you will not become a good programmer by watching others. What you need to do is do it with them, play while watching the gamer, follow the hands of the one playing the guitar, and understand the knowledge being shared to you by the developer. Do those things with the people you watch, putting in the work speaks louder than saying you have watched 8000 hours worth of tutorials.",
    takeaway:
      "Stop the constant watching and start doing. Yes, you will need tutorials, but you will also need to do what you should be doing. A talk that does not walk will not proceed.",
  },

    id: 4,
    main: "STAY HEALTHY",
    body: "Sitting all day infront of your computer is not healthy. That is why you need to put more work on your health. When it comes to being healthy, it targets both physical and mental health. Even if we do not move around often to get cramps, our brain will always be tired at the end of the day. To improve the stress capacity of your mind, then start improving body. Exercising helps clear the mind. This process will give you the energy to focus and think more logically. This step is true, and I vouch for it.",
    takeaway:
      "Be healthy for your body to be strong and your mind to be clear. You do not want to feel unpleasant things when programming, especially if what you are doing is challenging enough to drain you out.",

    main: "FEYNMANN TECHNIQUE",
    body: "Richard Feynmann is a physicist known for many things. One if these is his learning technique. Which is a process of choosing a topic; explaining it to a 12 year old; reflect, refine, simplify; and organize and review. You do not need to do all of these, but the essential part here is you will learn more by teaching. Let's say you studied an algorithm, try reteaching it to yourself or explain it to someone who is not a developer. You will learn other ways to describe and understand new things, which is a great way of processing information especially if you do not understand it in its technical form.",
    takeaway:
      "Teach what you learn to know your weakpoints. You will give others new knowledge while improving your own. This process is a great way to study the concepts in programming and even becoming a mentor.",
  },

    id: 6,
    main: "GET YOUR DOPAMINE, IT HITS",
    body: "Finish a project. Implement what you want to make. Develop the program you have been thinking of. Learning is painful, but the rewards you will receive are far more powerful. These are not physical gifts but are food for the brain. Dopamine hits when you finish something and that is what makes programming addicting. As a reference, finishing something that you did not think is possible will hit you with a greater amount of dopamine. Your confidence will be boosted, your self-esteem is better than ever, and most importantly, your knowledge pool is wider and deeper than before. But remember to create something you know you can finish.",
    takeaway:
      "Learning is painful, but the dopamine you receive after finishing a project is the best reward. You will be hooked more into programming. Make sure that the goals are achievable for better results.",

    main: "PACE YOURSELF, GET YOUR REGULAR BREAKS",
    body: "Do not be too hard on yourself. Errors are temporary, your health is always with you. Take breaks because this is one of the best way to fix an error or solve a bug, as an example, I have spent nights trying to fix an error only to lose sleep. However, after waking up, I realized that I have made a minor mistake. You should rest when you are tired because if not, your performance will not be better. Resting is also a way of studying because with this, you will refresh your mind and be ready to take on new problems to solve.",
    takeaway:
      "Do not let your ego take away your rest. Know when to take a break, because it is just taking a break; you are not stopping, you are resting. This is the way to think and perform better the next day or session.",
  },

    id: 8,
    main: "LET WHAT YOU WANT TO LEARN BE YOUR GUIDE",
    body: "In learning programming, you will encounter more things that are not entirely focused on what you want to know. There are new ideas, technologies, and terminologies that you will encounter everyday. These are knowledge that will provide more drive to your determination as they increase your curiosity in the things that happen in our field of technology.",
    takeaway:
      "Let knowledge flow when learning, do not disregard things that are new to you because these are information that will be added to your tools and skills in problem solving. Let your curiosity guide you because that is how people in the field of technology become better and more free.",
